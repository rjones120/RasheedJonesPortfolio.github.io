    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>At the heart of my setup is a smart hub, which serves as the central control unit for all connected devices. Through the hub, I have integrated various smart devices, including smart lights, Smart switches, security cameras(Soon to come), and my favorite Raspberry Pi. This allows me to control and monitor all aspects of my home from a single interface.

    <br /> <br />
        To achieve this level of automation, I have leveraged different tools and technologies. I use voice assistants like Amazon Alexa to issue voice commands and control my smart devices with ease.

    <br /> <br />
    I have implemented smart sensors throughout my home. These sensors detect motion, light, and temperature, triggering specific actions or adjustments. For instance, when I enter a room, the motion sensor detects my presence and automatically turns on the lights.
